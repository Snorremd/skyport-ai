# Build folder

This is the target folder for the JavaScript files compiled from the CoffeeScript source.
Do not directly edit JavaScript files in this folder as they will be overwritten by the compiled
CoffeeScript source files if grunt watch or grunt build is used.

JavaScript files in this folder are not included in the Git repository as they are build files. Use
grunt build to generate runnable Javascript files.
